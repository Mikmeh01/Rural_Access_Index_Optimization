# Rural_Access_Index_Optimization

This project was used for the [Paper](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/31309/WPS8746.pdf?sequence=5) that aims to quantify how much it will cost for developing countries to increase their Rural Access Index.

# Getting Started

Change the ISO3 country parameter (BLZ for Belize for example) of the RAI_Opti notebook and run the remaining code

# Output

The code exports a shapefile of roads added throughout the process with the corresponding increase of RAI at each iteration

# Installation

The requirement file lists all the necessary libraries used in this project
